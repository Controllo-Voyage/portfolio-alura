This is my first front-end project, which entails developing a text encryption tool using JavaScript. These are the encryption rules we'll be using:

    -The letter "e" will be transformed into "enter."
    -The letter "i" will be transformed into "imes."
    -The letter "a" will be transformed into "ai."
    -The letter "o" will be transformed into "ober."
    -The letter "u" will be transformed into "ufat."

Requirements:

    -The encryption system should only work with lowercase letters.
    -Special characters should not be supported in the encryption process.
    -The system should be capable of converting a word to its encrypted version.
    -The system should also be able to decrypt an encrypted word back to its original version.

    For example:
        "gato" => "gaitober"
        "gaitober" => "gato"

    -The page should have fields for inputting the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user should be able to choose between the two options.
    -The result should be displayed on the screen.
